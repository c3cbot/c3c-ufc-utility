A Chromium-based/Firefox-compatible browser extension. This extension will help you import/export UFC file (formerly known as FBState if used for Facebook) to be used for all sorts of things.

Currently supported Facebook only, more platforms will be added in the future if necessary.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that UFC file exported by this extension WILL LET OTHER PEOPLE/SOFTWARE ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE PLATFORM YOU EXPORTED FROM.
>
> **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT:**
> - **Sharing your UFC file with anyone you don't trust.**
> - **Passing your UFC file to programs/softwares that are not trustworthy, especially if it's a fork of common libraries that claim to do stuff that may seems impossible/unrealistic.**
>
> **YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THIS CAUTION!**

> [!NOTE]
> You should always use encrypted UFC file if possible unless you can't for better security when transporting and storing your UFC file.
